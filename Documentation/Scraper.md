#The Scraper

## Debugging

* The scraper needs to run on Google Chrome. This needs a tool called "ChromeDriver". This is different for different OSs and versions. If the scraper stops working for no apparent reason about once every 6 months, this is probably because the ChromeDriver and Google Chrome Browser need updated to the latest version.
